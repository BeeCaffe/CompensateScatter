 * This class is an implement version of paper "Compensating Indirect Scattering for immersive and Semi-Immersive
 * Projection Display", which is used to compensate the projector-camera system in L-shape screen.This method is a
 * tradition method for photometric compensation and need to understand the geometric information of projection
 * environment,and using iterator method to compensate images eventually.The detail inner-principle of this
 * program you'd better to refer the paper,which I have provided in the "resource/paper" directory.
